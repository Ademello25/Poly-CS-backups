IP and ARP are implemented and were tested on vogon. TCP was attempted and everything except checksum
functioned (few exceptions with the flags here). all TCP code is commented out currently because of 
bugs caused by some shortcomings in the early design phase of the program which cause inconsistent 
segfaults in the TCP code.

nothing past this was attempted.

apologies for the messy code, didnt get a chance to clean it up :(
