Lab 3 writeup Alex DeMello and Peter Chu

For -2 then 101, it took ~155
For 101 then -2 it took ~1000 instructions +- 50 to 100 due to counting errors

we think the latter test where -2 is the multiplier has so many more
instructions due to the fact that there is a leading 1 on the integer
which causes it to have to shift all the way down to perform on the signed
bit.
