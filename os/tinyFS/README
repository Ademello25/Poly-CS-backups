Vanessa Villa, and Alexander DeMello

Our tinyFS functions as specified with each of the functions.
We chose to implement Directory listing and renaming, read only 
support/writeByte support, as well as timestamps for each 
file as our three extra implementations.
In order to show that timestamps are working correctly we create a file
and write to it as well as access it and check the time stamps values 
within the file. This ensures that we are issuing our times correctly.

Compiles with "make" or "make clean all". will run with ./tinyFsDemo
