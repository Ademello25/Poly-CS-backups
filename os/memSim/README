   Program should run with just "make", then ./memSim <input File> <Frames>
   No attempt was made to implement anything other than FIFO page replacement
   so the command line argument for which algorithm to choose is not implemented
   This version of memSim only implements a basic TLB/Page table with fifo
   replacement.
