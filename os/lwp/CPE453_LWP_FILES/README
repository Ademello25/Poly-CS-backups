      Does not compile or run do to some short sightedness. I didn't pass OS last 
   quarter but wrote a version of lwp and assumed I would be able to convert 
   it easily while working on my networks assignments, this wasn't the case. 
   The result is a half converted lwp file that doesn't compile or run. 
   I'm turning this in at some hope of starting the race with a sprained ankle 
   instead of a broken one.

   Question answer: lwp cannot guarentee mutual exclusiveness between threads 
      because it lacks a way to synchronize. Most basic thread management libraries
      contain ways to guarentee mutual exclusiveness. LWP also does not include
      semaphors which are also used for synchronizing threads. Adding semaphors 
      and synchronization primitives will allow threads to run critical sections
      without being preempted.
