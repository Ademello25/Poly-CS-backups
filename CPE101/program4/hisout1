To get started, I'll need a seed value to generate
psuedo-random numbers. Enter 0 for random behavior
or any other integer for predictable behavior.

Seed: 
Wow, what a great seed value! I never would have thought of 5!

The Boggle board is:

T L W Q S
O K P H D
W U U O E
A M W K S
W X H J V

What string would you like to look for? 
The search results are:

 Forward: TL occurs first at row 0 column 0
Backward: TL does not occur in the Boggle board!
  Upward: TL does not occur in the Boggle board!
Downward: TL does not occur in the Boggle board!

Would you like to look for another string (yes/no)?
