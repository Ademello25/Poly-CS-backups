Double precision is still broken as last week, couldnt make it to office hours
because of interviews this week. I plan on coming to you in office hours or
lab to figure out why fread is reading 0's in the case of DOUBLE being defined.

Single precision runtime tests for 1048x1048 matrix
1          2          3
1.964s    1.945s     1.954s

Single precision runtime tests for 32x32 matrix
1          2          3
.384s     .384s     .369s

these times are notably faster than the my sgemm and dgemm implementations
and that is because i have reverted to row major and did not use fseek as
was used in the sgemm/dgemm implementation
