Only managed to expand to functionality to include non-square matricies, was not able to turn in a version that has a working shared memory implementation and performance reflects that. 

Double precision is still broken as it has been, still keep forgetting to find time to fix this annoying bug.

speedup % from part b:
32x32:      158.6%
555x777:    N/A (non-square matrices appeared not to function in this version)
1048x1048:  242%

performance
.587

these times are notably faster than the my sgemm and dgemm implementations
and that is because i have reverted to row major and did not use fseek as
was used in the sgemm/dgemm implementation
