to compile use
   make DOUBLE COLMAJ          for double precision column major
just use
   make        for single precision row major 

if make isnt recompiling and giving "mm up to date" then rm mm from the folder

to run use
./mm <file1> <file2>    dont use any other commands use this specific line
